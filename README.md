# BIP-39-Seed-Phrase-100mm-Wallet

This is a simple template for the creation of a physical BIP-39 Seed Phrase Wallet that is able to withstand a house fire or similar damage.  The idea is to purchase readily available 100mm x 100mm Titanium Plates from sources on the internet such as Amazon or EBay.  Print the desired 100mm x 100mm Seed Phrase file and glue it to one side of the titanium plate.  Two files are included.  One for Seed Words 1 through 12.  Another for Seed Words 13 through 24.  You can get a 24 Word Seed on one sheet of titanium by using both sides.  In the top left corner of each sheet is a dot or double-dot.  This is used to diferentiate between the 1-12 and 12-24 sides.  Additionally these dots serve as an index for realigning a new sheet should you need to recover your Seed.
